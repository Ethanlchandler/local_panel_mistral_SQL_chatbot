# üëü **Local Async Data Engineer Chatbot with Mistral**

This is a **local, asynchronous chatbot** designed to act as a data engineering assistant. It's built using **Panel** for the user interface and powered by the **Mistral** language model via **Ollama**, ensuring all processing occurs locally. This tool allows you to interact with a data engineering expert through natural language prompts, receiving code suggestions, explanations, and assistance directly within the chat interface.

üîë **Key Benefits:**

-   **Local Execution:** All LLM processing happens locally using Ollama, ensuring data privacy and no reliance on external APIs.
-   **Asynchronous Processing:** Utilizes `asyncio` for non-blocking operations, providing a responsive and smooth user experience.
-   **Mistral Power:** Leverages the Mistral language model for high-quality and contextually relevant responses.
-   **Data Engineering Focus:** Pre-configured with a system context to act as a dedicated data engineering assistant.
-   **Interactive Chat Interface:** Built with Panel's `ChatInterface` for a user-friendly and intuitive experience.

üìé This tool is particularly useful for **rapid prototyping, learning, and developing data engineering workflows** in a secure and offline environment.
